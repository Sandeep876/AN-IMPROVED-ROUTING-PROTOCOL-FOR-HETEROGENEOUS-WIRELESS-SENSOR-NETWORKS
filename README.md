Over the last few years, the IoT paradigm has evolved as one of the biggest technological advances of modern science. With the evolving era of WiFi and 4G-LTE wireless access of Internet IoT enabled devices like computer, tablets, and mobile phones are able to access information about the environment and other objects without human intervention.
With the advent of technology, this decade is witnessing a shift from conventional approaches to the most advanced ones. 

The proposed system makes use of Matlab Software.
The proposed method aims to reduce extra power consumption by avoiding unnecessary clusters and CHs formation in each round.
After CH selection, the proposed algorithm assigns a high level of energy to the node. For the subsequent rounds, when the node again becomes a sensing node, 
the low level of energy will be assigned. This variation of energy level for different nodes will be beneficial for maintaining proper energy distribution in the network.
This approach is effective in terms of time ,power consumption, cost and more accurate than the pre existing Algorithms.
